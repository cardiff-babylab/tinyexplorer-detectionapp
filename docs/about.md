### Project Team

- **Concept and Project Management:** Teodor Nikolov & Hana D'Souza
- **Lead Development and Implementation:** Tamas Foldes
- **Code Contributions:** Ziye Zhang & Teodor Nikolov

## Privacy & Data Security

**All processing is performed entirely on your local machine.** No images, videos, or detection results are ever uploaded to external servers. Your research data stays completely private and under your control.

- No cloud processing or data transmission
- No internet connection required after initial model download
- Models are downloaded once and stored locally
- Ideal for working with sensitive research data involving human subjects

## Research Applications

This application was developed to support developmental psychology research at Cardiff Babylab, enabling:

- Automated face detection in experimental recordings
- Batch processing of research data
- Standardized data extraction for statistical analysis
- Cross-platform deployment for research teams

## Technical Stack

The application combines modern web technologies with machine learning frameworks:

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Desktop Framework:** Electron
- **Backend:** Python with Flask
- **Machine Learning:** YOLO (PyTorch) and RetinaFace (TensorFlow)
- **Cross-platform:** Windows, macOS, and Linux support
