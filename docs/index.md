## Overview
The TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp is a user-friendly graphical interface designed specifically for developmental psychologists working with infants and young children. This toolbox integrates state-of-the-art open-source face recognition algorithms into an easy-to-use software package, streamlining the process of analyzing facial data in developmental research.

## Features
- Simple graphical user interface for easy operation
- Integration of cutting-edge face recognition models
- Batch processing capabilities for efficient analysis of large datasets
- Customizable confidence thresholds for detection accuracy

## Basic Usage

### Install a Prebuilt Release (recommended)
- Download the latest installer for your OS from the [Releases page](https://github.com/cardiff-babylab/tinyexplorer-facedetectionapp/releases).
- Run the installer and launch the app.

### Build Locally with npm (fallback)
If no release exists for your system or the installer doesn’t work, you can build locally.

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start in development:
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
- Create a distributable build:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
